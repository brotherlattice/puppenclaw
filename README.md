# Puppenclaw

Puppenclaw is a native OpenClaw plugin that turns ACP-backed coding agents into a project-aware orchestration runtime.

Today it provides:
- named Claude Code or Codex ACP sessions
- project registration and context capture
- campaign templates for baseline work, literature review, ablations, self-improvement loops, and Codex-vs-Claude fusion runs
- artifact capture and approval gates
- optional daemon mode
- `oc2oc`-aware remote control paths for mediated delegation between OpenClaw peers

Puppenclaw does **not** yet implement a full typed orchestration transport inside `oc2oc`. The current `oc2oc` integration is conversation-mediated: remote assistants can delegate into Puppenclaw through bound and exposed `oc2oc` conversations, and Puppenclaw then runs work locally on the target node.

## What Works Now

- Local orchestration on one OpenClaw instance
- Daemon-backed orchestration over the local HTTP daemon
- Claude Code / Codex ACP session management
- Project context sync into reusable bundles
- Campaign templates:
  - `literature_review`
  - `baseline_from_scratch`
  - `ablation_campaign`
  - `self_improvement_loop`
  - `puppenfusion`
  - `custom`
- Approval gating and resume
- Artifact listing and retention pruning
- Research-command delegation via `orchestration.gptResearcherCommand`
- `oc2oc`-mediated remote `/puppenclaw` command flow when the remote conversation is explicitly bound and exposed

## What This Repo Contains

This is a source repository.

Checked-in source:
- `index.ts`
- `src/**`
- `test/**`
- `skills/**`
- `scripts/sync-manifest.mts`
- `openclaw.plugin.json`

Generated at build time:
- `dist/**`

If you install from the repo path, run `npm run build` first. `dist/` is not meant to be committed.

## Prerequisites

- Node `>=22.13`
- npm
- an OpenClaw installation on the machine where the plugin will run
- working ACP adapter commands for the agents you plan to use

Default ACP adapter commands:
- Claude: `npx -y @zed-industries/claude-agent-acp`
- Codex: `npx @zed-industries/codex-acp`

Puppenclaw does not log you into model providers for you. Make sure the ACP adapter you plan to use already works on that machine before blaming Puppenclaw.

## How Puppenclaw launches Codex and Claude

Puppenclaw launches ACP agents in two layers:

- `acpxCommand`
  - the outer ACP launcher binary
  - example: `/absolute/path/to/acpx`
- `agentCommands`
  - the actual ACP adapters that `acpx` runs
  - examples:
    - `npx @zed-industries/codex-acp`
    - `npx -y @zed-industries/claude-agent-acp`

The execution path is:

```text
/puppenclaw start -> Puppenclaw -> acpx -> codex-acp or claude-agent-acp
```

Important:

- `acpxCommand` is not the agent adapter command
- `agentCommands` are not a replacement for `acpxCommand`
- the ACP adapters run inside the OpenClaw gateway/plugin host environment
- that means the adapter sees the gateway's `HOME`, `PATH`, and auth files unless you override them in `agentCommands`

Preferred setup:

- run OpenClaw/Puppenclaw in an isolated `HOME`
- seed the required Codex and Claude auth into that same `HOME`
- keep `agentCommands` as the normal ACP adapter commands

Local development fallback:

- wrap `agentCommands` with `env HOME=/home/your-user ...` if you intentionally want Puppenclaw to reuse your existing shell auth

Example local config:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "puppenclaw": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "backend": "local",
          "acpxCommand": "/absolute/path/to/acpx",
          "defaultAgent": "codex",
          "agentCommands": {
            "codex": "npx @zed-industries/codex-acp",
            "claude": "npx -y @zed-industries/claude-agent-acp"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Local development fallback example:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "puppenclaw": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "backend": "local",
          "acpxCommand": "/absolute/path/to/acpx",
          "agentCommands": {
            "codex": "env HOME=/home/your-user npx @zed-industries/codex-acp",
            "claude": "env HOME=/home/your-user npx -y @zed-industries/claude-agent-acp"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Install From This Repo

From a clean checkout:

```bash
cd /absolute/path/to/puppenclaw
npm install
npm run build
openclaw plugins install /absolute/path/to/puppenclaw
```

Then restart the OpenClaw gateway.

This path is the one a later Codex session should use when bootstrapping from source.

In local plugin mode, Puppenclaw stores its runtime state under the OpenClaw plugin state directory for that gateway instance. It should not create or use a repo-local `orchestrator/` directory in the checkout.

## Install From a Packed Tarball

If you want a release-style artifact instead of installing from the repo path:

```bash
cd /absolute/path/to/puppenclaw
npm install
npm run build
npm pack
openclaw plugins install /absolute/path/to/puppenclaw/puppenclaw-openclaw-plugin-0.1.0.tgz
```

Use the actual tarball name produced by `npm pack`.

## Development Verification

```bash
cd /absolute/path/to/puppenclaw
npm install
npm run verify
```

That runs manifest sync, build, typecheck, and tests.

## Configuration

Configure Puppenclaw under `plugins.entries.puppenclaw.config`.

Minimal local mode:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "puppenclaw": {

          }
        }
      }
    }

}
```

### Config Notes

- `backend`
  - `local`: plugin process talks to ACP adapters directly
  - `daemon`: plugin talks to a standalone Puppenclaw HTTP daemon
- `acpxCommand`
  - path or command used to start the ACP launcher
  - Puppenclaw calls this first, then passes the selected adapter command through it
- `agentCommands`
  - per-agent ACP adapter commands
  - use wrapper commands here when adapter auth must come from a different `HOME`
- `orchestration.maxCampaigns`
  - maximum number of active campaigns in `draft`, `running`, or `waiting_approval`
- `orchestration.artifactRetentionHours`
  - old artifacts are pruned on runtime access
- `orchestration.defaultProjectRoot`
  - base directory used to resolve relative `project.rootDir` values
- `orchestration.allowLocalCommandExecution`
  - required for `command` steps and built-in evaluation/experiment commands
- `orchestration.gptResearcherCommand`
  - optional shell command for `research` steps
  - Puppenclaw sends the step prompt to stdin
  - Puppenclaw expects dossier text on stdout
  - environment variables exposed:
    - `PUPPENCLAW_PROJECT_ID`
    - `PUPPENCLAW_PROJECT_NAME`
    - `PUPPENCLAW_PROJECT_ROOT`
    - `PUPPENCLAW_CAMPAIGN_ID`
    - `PUPPENCLAW_CAMPAIGN_NAME`
    - `PUPPENCLAW_STEP_ID`
    - `PUPPENCLAW_STEP_TITLE`
    - `PUPPENCLAW_TASK`

Example research-command config:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "puppenclaw": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "backend": "local",
          "orchestration": {
            "gptResearcherCommand": "python /absolute/path/to/research-wrapper.py"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running the Daemon

If you use `backend: "daemon"`, start the daemon separately after the repo is built:

```bash
cd /absolute/path/to/puppenclaw
npm run build
node dist/daemon/cli.js start --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18795 --data-dir /absolute/path/to/puppenclaw-state
```

Check health:

```bash
node dist/daemon/cli.js status --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18795
```

Stop it:

```bash
node dist/daemon/cli.js stop --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18795
```

## OpenClaw Usage Surfaces

Puppenclaw exposes three main surfaces:

1. Agent tools
- `puppenclaw_project_create`
- `puppenclaw_worker_register`
- `puppenclaw_context_sync`
- `puppenclaw_campaign_start`
- `puppenclaw_campaign_status`
- `puppenclaw_artifacts`
- `puppenclaw_campaign_approve`
- `puppenclaw_campaign_cancel`
- `puppenclaw_reassessment_start`
- `puppenclaw_reassessment_status`
- `puppenclaw_reassessment_report`

2. Raw ACP session tools
- `puppenclaw_start`
- `puppenclaw_send`
- `puppenclaw_status`
- `puppenclaw_stop`
- `puppenclaw_resume`
- `puppenclaw_fork`
- `puppenclaw_cost`

3. `/puppenclaw` command
- mirrors the same behavior for deterministic command-style control

Gateway methods:
- `puppenclaw.projectCreate`
- `puppenclaw.workerRegister`
- `puppenclaw.contextSync`
- `puppenclaw.campaignRun`
- `puppenclaw.campaignStatus`
- `puppenclaw.artifacts`
- `puppenclaw.campaignApprove`
- `puppenclaw.campaignCancel`
- `puppenclaw.reassessmentStart`
- `puppenclaw.reassessmentStatus`
- `puppenclaw.reassessmentReport`

## Quick Start: Local Orchestration

These are the exact steps a future Codex session can follow.

1. Create and install the plugin

```bash
cd /absolute/path/to/puppenclaw
npm install
npm run build
openclaw plugins install /absolute/path/to/puppenclaw
```

2. Restart the gateway

3. Configure the plugin in OpenClaw with at least:
- `backend`
- `defaultAgent`
- `agentCommands`
- `orchestration.defaultProjectRoot`

4. In an OpenClaw conversation, create the project

```text
/puppenclaw project {"name":"demo-project","rootDir":"demo-project","description":"Main repo"}
```

Because `rootDir` is relative here, Puppenclaw resolves it under `orchestration.defaultProjectRoot`.

5. Register or confirm the local worker

```text
/puppenclaw worker {"id":"local","label":"Local Worker","labels":["local"],"projectRoots":["/absolute/path/to/workspaces"]}
```

6. Sync context

```text
/puppenclaw sync {"projectId":"demo-project","includeFiles":["AGENTS.md","README.md"],"memoryText":"Use npm, run tests, keep code terse."}
```

7. Run a baseline campaign

```text
/puppenclaw campaign {"projectId":"demo-project","workerId":"local","name":"baseline","template":"baseline_from_scratch","task":"Implement the first working baseline for this repo.","evaluationCommand":"npm test"}
```

Or run a fusion campaign that gives Codex and Claude the same sealed input bundle, cross-reviews both outputs, and performs a final merge pass:

```text
/puppenclaw campaign {"projectId":"demo-project","workerId":"local","name":"fusion-pass","template":"puppenfusion","task":"Implement the feature end to end.","evaluationCommand":"npm test","fusionPreferredAgent":"codex"}
```

Or reassess older Puppenclaw, Codex, and Claude Code sessions with a newer model. Puppenclaw imports matching project history, creates a new branch/worktree, asks the target model to patch only concrete old-model mistakes, runs validation, and stores a report. The base branch is never merged automatically.

```text
/puppenclaw reassess {"projectId":"demo-project","workerId":"local","targetModel":"gpt-new","providers":["puppenclaw","codex","claude"],"validationCommand":"npm test"}
```

8. Inspect status

```text
/puppenclaw campaign-status {"projectId":"demo-project"}
```

9. Inspect artifacts

```text
/puppenclaw artifacts {"projectId":"demo-project"}
```

10. If the campaign paused for approval, resume it

```text
/puppenclaw approve {"campaignId":"camp-..."}
```

## Campaign Templates

### `literature_review`

Use for citation-conscious research or landscape mapping.

Behavior:
- by default, runs as an ACP `research` step
- if `orchestration.gptResearcherCommand` is configured, Puppenclaw runs that command instead and stores stdout as a `research-dossier` artifact

### `baseline_from_scratch`

Use for:
- plan
- implement
- optionally evaluate with `evaluationCommand`

### `ablation_campaign`

Use when you already know the concrete experiment commands.

Example:

```text
/puppenclaw campaign {"projectId":"demo-project","workerId":"local","name":"ablation-1","template":"ablation_campaign","task":"Compare prompt variants.","experimentCommands":["python run_a.py","python run_b.py"]}
```

### `self_improvement_loop`

Repeats:
- planning
- implementation
- optional evaluation
- review

Control loop size with `iterations`.

### `puppenfusion`

Use when you want both Codex and Claude to work from the same sealed project brief, then fuse the results into a stronger final implementation.

Behavior:
- requires a clean git worktree at campaign start
- creates separate local-only worktrees for the Codex candidate, the Claude candidate, and the final merged candidate
- gives both planning and implementation runs the same sealed bundle:
  - task
  - scope and non-scope
  - constraints
  - validation plan
  - synced project context
  - exact base commit
- runs a planning round first:
  - Codex produces a structured plan review
  - Claude produces a structured plan review
  - OpenClaw synthesizes one canonical fusion plan
- pauses for approval after the synthesized fusion plan and before implementation starts
- requires both implementation runs to emit a structured implementation memo
- records a structured candidate handoff artifact for each backend with commit and validation metadata
- runs fresh cross-review sessions:
  - Codex reviews the Claude candidate
  - Claude reviews the Codex candidate
- synthesizes a fusion dossier from both memos and both peer reviews
- optionally sends that dossier to an external arbiter command if configured
- attempts automatic local git integration first, without PRs or manual merging
- only falls back to one final resolver merge pass with the fixed `fusionPreferredAgent` when automatic integration reports a conflict or unresolved path

Use `fusionPreferredAgent` to choose which backend performs the final merge run. If omitted, Puppenclaw falls back to the project's `fusionPreferredAgent`, then `defaultAgent`, then the plugin default agent.

Example:

```text
/puppenclaw campaign {"projectId":"demo-project","workerId":"local","name":"feature-fusion","template":"puppenfusion","task":"Implement the feature end to end.","evaluationCommand":"npm test","fusionPreferredAgent":"claude","useExternalArbiter":true}
```

### `custom`

Use only when the built-in templates are not the right fit.

Example:

```text
/puppenclaw campaign {"projectId":"demo-project","workerId":"local","name":"custom-run","template":"custom","steps":[{"title":"Design","kind":"plan","executor":"acp","instruction":"Design the next phase."},{"title":"Run tests","kind":"eval","executor":"command","command":"npm test"}]}
```

## Raw ACP Session Control

Raw sessions still exist and are useful for admin or debugging work.

Examples:

```text
/puppenclaw start {"agent":"codex","name":"api-refactor","directory":".","task":"Implement the server side."}
/puppenclaw send {"name":"api-refactor","message":"Continue and run tests.","stream":true}
/puppenclaw status {}
/puppenclaw stop {"name":"api-refactor"}
```

Use the orchestration surface first when the work is project-shaped. Use raw sessions when the operator explicitly wants direct ACP control.

## ACP Verification

Before blaming Puppenclaw, prove the ACP stack from the same `HOME` and `cwd`
that the gateway will use.

1. Verify `acpx` itself exists:

```bash
/absolute/path/to/acpx --help
```

2. Verify the adapter can create a session from the same environment:

```bash
HOME=/path/to/openclaw-home /absolute/path/to/acpx --format json --json-strict --cwd /absolute/path/to/project codex sessions new --name smoke-test
HOME=/path/to/openclaw-home /absolute/path/to/acpx --format json --json-strict --cwd /absolute/path/to/project claude sessions new --name smoke-test
```

3. Verify the adapter can answer a prompt from the same environment:

```bash
HOME=/path/to/openclaw-home printf '%s' 'Reply with exactly OK and stop.' | /absolute/path/to/acpx --format json --json-strict --cwd /absolute/path/to/project --approve-reads --non-interactive-permissions deny codex prompt --session smoke-test --file -
HOME=/path/to/openclaw-home printf '%s' 'Reply with exactly OK and stop.' | /absolute/path/to/acpx --format json --json-strict --cwd /absolute/path/to/project --approve-reads --non-interactive-permissions deny claude prompt --session smoke-test --file -
```

4. Only after those succeed, run `/puppenclaw start`.

If your OpenClaw gateway uses an isolated `HOME`, run these checks with that
same `HOME`, not your normal shell profile.

## oc2oc Integration

Current state:
- Puppenclaw recognizes `oc2oc` as a remote channel
- mediated remote control is supported
- deterministic pure-pipe control is supported only when explicitly enabled and exposed
- full typed Puppenclaw-over-`oc2oc` orchestration transport is not yet implemented

Remote control safety gates:
- `remoteControl.requireConversationBinding`
- `/puppenclaw bind`
- `/puppenclaw expose {"agents":["codex"],"allowPurePipe":true}`

Example remote setup flow inside an `oc2oc` conversation:

```text
/puppenclaw bind
/puppenclaw expose {"agents":["codex"],"allowPurePipe":true}
/puppenclaw campaign {"projectId":"remote-project","workerId":"local","name":"baseline","template":"baseline_from_scratch","task":"Implement the worker baseline.","evaluationCommand":"npm test"}
```

## Troubleshooting

### `Project root does not exist`

- Check `orchestration.defaultProjectRoot`
- Check whether `rootDir` was meant to be absolute or relative

### `Worker ... is not allowed to operate on ...`

- Expand `worker.projectRoots`
- Register the worker again with the correct allowed roots

### `Worker ... does not support command execution`

- Either enable `orchestration.allowLocalCommandExecution`
- Or register the worker with `executors: ["acp", "command"]`
- Or use a campaign that does not rely on command steps

### `Puppenclaw daemon is unreachable`

- Start the daemon
- Verify `daemonUrl`
- Run `node dist/daemon/cli.js status --host ... --port ...`

### ACP adapter starts fail

- `spawn acpx ENOENT`
  - `acpx` is not installed or `acpxCommand` is wrong
- `Authentication required`
  - the ACP adapter cannot see valid auth from the gateway/plugin `HOME`
  - either seed auth into that `HOME` or wrap `agentCommands` with an explicit `HOME=...`
- `acpx exited with code 4`
  - rerun the same `acpx` command manually with the same `HOME` and `cwd` as the gateway
  - treat it as an adapter/runtime error until the direct `acpx` test succeeds
- `No acpx session found`
  - the ACP session was never created or is not visible from the current `HOME`
- In all cases, verify the configured `agentCommands` work outside Puppenclaw from the same environment the gateway uses
